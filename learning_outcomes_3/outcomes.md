Learning outcomes:

* Draw the architecture of the classic perceptron model, along with the notation
* Write, implement (using numpy and pytorch) and demonstrate the workings of the perceptron learning algorithm
* Determine for any given dataset if perceptron would be suitable for modeling.
* Demonstrate the utility of vectorization in python and it's usefulness in perceptron learning algorithm
